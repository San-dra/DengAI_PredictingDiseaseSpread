Predicting the number of dengue fever cases reported each week in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru.รง

"Accurate dengue predictions would help public health workers ... and people around the world take steps to 
reduce the impact of these epidemics. But predicting dengue is a hefty task that calls for the consolidation 
of different data sets on disease incidence, weather, and the environment."

Because it is carried by mosquitoes, the transmission dynamics of dengue are related to climate variables 
such as temperature and precipitation. Although the relationship to climate is complex, a growing number of 
scientists argue that climate change is likely to produce distributional shifts that will have significant 
public health implications worldwide.
